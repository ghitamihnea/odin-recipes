        <p>It takes a little work, but it is worth it.</p>
        <h2><a href="pasta.html">Pasta carbonara recipe</a> </h2>
        <p>This is a very lightly sauced pasta with lemon and shrimp. It's refreshing as well as filling.</p>
        <h2><a href="pizza.html">Pizza recipe</a></h2>
        <p>This is an excellent pizza crust recipe. I have found it is really good when baked on a pizza stone.</p>
